# Example Usage

# Accessing public member

# Accessing protected member

# Accessing private member using getter
print(dog.get_age())

# Modifying private member using setter
dog.set_age(5)

#A Class in Python has three types of access modifiers: 1) Public Access Modifier: Theoretically, public methods and fields can be accessed directly by any class. 2) Protected Access Modifier: Theoretically, protected methods and fields can be accessed within the same class it is declared and its subclass. 3) Private Access Modifier: Theoretically, private methods and fields can be only accessed within the same class it is declared.
